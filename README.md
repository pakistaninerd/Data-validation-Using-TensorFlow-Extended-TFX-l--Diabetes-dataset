# Data-validation-Using-TensorFlow-Extended-TFX on a Diabetes-dataset

Improving data quality will help drive your model's performance by detecting possible issues such as malformed values, distribution skew, and unfair bias. In this project  will be performing common data validation steps to examine the Diabetes dataset. 

Tensorflow Data Validation (TFDV) is an open-source library that helps to understand, validate, and monitor production machine learning (ML) data at scale. Common use-cases include comparing training, evaluation and serving datasets, as well as checking for training/serving skew. You have seen the core functionalities of this package in this project 
In this project we will use TFDV in order to:

1)Generate and visualize statistics from a dataframe
2)Infer a dataset schema
3)Calculate, visualize and fix anomalies
